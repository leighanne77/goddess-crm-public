/**
 * Playwright config for the lynda-crm frontend smoke test.
 *
 * Single-browser (chromium) by design — this suite is a smoke test, not
 * comprehensive coverage. It catches UI regressions without needing the
 * real backend running.
 *
 * The test uses `page.route()` to mock every /api/* call, so no backend
 * (FastAPI, Postgres) is required to run `npm run test:e2e`.
 *
 * Written as CommonJS (.cjs) because this workspace's Node (18.17) is
 * older than Playwright's ESM-loader requirement (18.19+). The .spec.ts
 * files can stay TypeScript — Playwright transpiles those via ts-node
 * internally. Bump to .mjs or .ts if Node gets upgraded.
