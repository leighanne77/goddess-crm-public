# Lynda CRM — multi-stage container image for Cloud Run.
#
# Stage 1 (frontend-build): compile the React/Vite frontend. Only npm
# tools and source live here; nothing from this stage ships in the
# final image except the built `dist/` directory.
#
# Stage 2 (runtime): python slim + installed dependencies + backend
# code + the `dist/` copied from stage 1. Cloud Run expects the
# container to listen on $PORT (default 8080) and terminate gracefully
# on SIGTERM — uvicorn handles both.
#
# Startup order:
#   1. `alembic upgrade head`  (applies any pending migrations)
#   2. `uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080`
#
# Migrations run IN-CONTAINER at startup so a Cloud Run deploy is a
# single rollout. Day 6 Pitfall 4 notes that any migration touching
# existing rows at scale should be reviewed before deploy; Phase 1
# migrations are all additive + fast.

# System deps — libpq isn't needed (psycopg[binary] ships its own),
# but ca-certificates is required for outbound HTTPS to Anthropic /
# Google, and tini handles PID-1 signal forwarding on Cloud Run.
# Phase 3 Slice 2 adds ffmpeg for server-side audio transcoding —
# browsers produce different formats (Safari M4A, Chrome WebM/Opus,
# Firefox Ogg/Opus) and Chirp 2 silently fails on M4A. ffmpeg
# normalizes everything to WAV (LINEAR16 mono 16kHz) before the
# provider call. Image size impact: ~110 MB.

# Copy everything needed to install the package. pyproject.toml's
# [tool.setuptools] packages = ["app"] means pip needs to SEE app/
# at install time — so app/ comes before pip install, not after.
# Cache loss: every app-code change re-runs pip install (~30s on CI,
# faster locally). Worth it for Phase 1 simplicity; a requirements.txt
# split is an easy optimization if build speed becomes a concern.
