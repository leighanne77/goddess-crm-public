"""Tool schemas for Claude.

Each tool input is a Pydantic model with explicit fields and (where
possible) Literal types — no free-form dicts. This is the surface
Claude is allowed to call. The dispatcher in app/services/tool_dispatch
(Slice 5) validates every Claude-generated tool call against these
schemas before executing anything.

Adding a new tool:
1. Define a `*Input(BaseModel)` with strict types.
2. Add a `ToolSpec` entry in `TOOL_REGISTRY`.
3. Wire the handler in app/services/tool_dispatch.
