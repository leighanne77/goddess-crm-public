"""Warm-introduction pathfinder (Phase 5 Slice 3) — the DB-touching half.

Builds candidate introduction paths to a target by walking the
`relationships` graph (up to 2 hops, edges treated as bidirectional for
reachability), then hands them to the pure scorer
(`intro_paths.rank_paths`). The pure engine stays DB-free; all SQLAlchemy
lives here.

**Privacy composes with the gate.** We only ever load contacts the
requester can *see* (`visible_contacts_query`), so a path can never route
through — or reveal — a contact the requester isn't allowed to see. On top
of that, `rank_paths` drops any path through a blocklisted (`Off Fly List`)
or non-`APPROVED` intermediary. So the answer respects, in order: the
three-tier privacy filter, then the blocklist, then outreach consent.

**Why in-memory, not a recursive CTE.** For a team-sized CRM, loading the
visible contacts + the edges among them and enumerating 1- and 2-hop chains
in Python is simpler and far more testable than recursive SQL. If the graph
ever gets large, push the walk into a `WITH RECURSIVE` query — the scoring
and the interface don't change.

**Scoping.** When the requester is linked to their own contact record
(`contacts.user_id`, set by email-match), paths are scoped to the
requester's *own* relationships: the first intermediary — whom we'd
actually reach out to — must be someone the requester directly knows, and
the requester is never routed through or to. When the requester has no
linked contact node, we fall back to firm-wide reachability over all
visible contacts (the original v1 behavior). The first intermediary in a
path is whom we'd actually reach out to.
