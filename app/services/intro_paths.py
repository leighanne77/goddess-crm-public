"""Warm-introduction engine — deterministic scoring (Phase 5 Slice 2).

Pure functions, no database, no model. This is the trust-critical core:
the math that decides whether a path is usable and how warm it is lives
here, in code, auditable and unit-tested — Claude never decides who's
blocklisted or how warm a contact is. Slice 3 (the recursive-CTE
pathfinder) builds candidate paths from the `relationships` graph and
hands them to `rank_paths`; this file does not touch SQLAlchemy.

A path answers three questions (see Docs/Phase_5_Warm_Intro_Engine.md):

1. GATES — can we use this path at all? A path is discarded if any
   intermediary is blocklisted (fly_status='Off Fly List') or not opted
   in (opt_in_status != 'APPROVED'). Gates delete, they don't score.
2. OUR-SIDE WARMTH (affinity) — how well do we know the person we'd
   actually contact, i.e. the FIRST intermediary. Mapped from fly_status.
3. THEIR-SIDE CONNECTION — how well does each go-between know the next
   node, ending at the target. Sector overlap + shared_history per edge.

    path_score = affinity(first intermediary)
               * product(connection over each edge to the target)
               / degrees_of_separation

Geography (same metro) is a term in `connection` — see W_GEO. Everything
here is a tunable constant on purpose; reweight the W_* values freely.
